Internet Speed Twitter Complaint Bot

I compare the Internet Service Provider guaranteed internet speed with the current live download and upload speeds that I get using speedtest.net website.

Create a class InternetSpeedTwitterBot with two methods get_internet_speed() and tweet_at_provider()

Outside of the class, I initialise the object and call the method tweet_at_provider() if the speeds that I get are lower than the promised ones.
