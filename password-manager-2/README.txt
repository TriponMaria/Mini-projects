* Building a Password Manager *

-> We are going to use this program to store (into a JSON file) and generate passwords

For example, if I wanted to create an account on a particular website, then 
I enter the name of the website, my email is already populated and then all I have to do is to either come up with a strong password or I can use the builtin generate password to just generate for me a very complex, very long password with all the required numbers and symbols and all of that. Once I've done with that, then I can click "Add" and I get a popup asking me if this is okay and if that all looks good then I click "Yes" and that data gets added to a text file which I have on my computer.
It's got some basic validations. So if you, for example, leave one of the fields empty and you click "Add", you get a popup that tells you: "Please don't leave any fields empty!" or if you generate a password then you can actually immediately use it by pasting it. What's happening behind the scenes is as soon as I click on "Generate password" then my password is saved onto my clipboard and I can paste it into the password field on the website I'm trying to sign up for.

With this program we are able to save websites, generate passwords and add it to a database of passwords. We also be able to search through that database, so we could type in the name of a website, click on "Search" button, and it'll tell us what email and password is that we need to use to log onto that website.
